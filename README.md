##About MyTopHHA.com
MyTopHHA.com is a website where you can make a list of your top Hip Hop Artists based off of the criteria that you've set. First, you set your criteria from a list of categories. Next, you give ratings to whichever Hip Hop artists you'd like to rate. After you are done setting the criteria and making your ratings, you can view a list of your top Hip Hop artists.


## Setting your Criteria
Before rating any artists, you should first set your criteria on the "My Criteria" page. Here, you will set a criteria based off of what you think makes a great Hip Hop artist. You will be shown a list of categories and will be able to give scores to each category. You should give higher scores to the categories that you believe are more important to determining a great Hip Hop artist. The categories you score higher will weigh more to an artists rating than the categories you give a lower score to. All category scores must add up to 100 before you save your criteria. If you need an explanation for any of the categories, hover over the icon next to the category name.


## Rating Artists
After your criteria is set, you then should go to the "Rate Artists" page where you can choose from a selection of artists to rate. Simply search for and select an artist from the dropdown. Once an artist is selected, you can then give the artist a rating from 1 to 10 in each of the categories. The better you believe the artist is in a particular category, the higher score you should give them. You can do this for as many artists as you want. Make sure to click the "Save Rating" button when you are done rating an artist.


## Viewing your Top Hip Hop Artists
After your criteria is set and you are done rating artists, you can finally view your top Hip Hop artist list. Head to the "My Top Artists" page and you will see a list of your top artists. Each artist will have a "score" based off both your criteria and the ratings you gave to them. The artists are then listed in order by this score. The artist's number ranking in your list will be shown to the left of their name. Also, if you hover over an artist's name, their score will be shown to the left on the outside of their tab.


## How the artist scores are calculated
For each category, the rating (from 1 to 10) that you give the artist is multiplied by the number you set to that category for your criteria. Those values for each category are then all added up to get the total score for the artist. The lowest total score an artist can get is 100 and the highest score is 1000.


## Other Notes
Depending on how many artists you have rated, this list might span over multiple pages. Only 10 artists will be shown per page. You can navigate the pages at the bottom of the page.

Your top artist list will not show until you have set your criteria and rated at least 1 artist.

On the "My Top Artists" page you can also delete ratings. You can choose to delete individual artist ratings by clicking the Ã— icon on the right side of the artist's tab. You can also delete all of your saved artist ratings by clicking the "Delete All Ratings" button at the top of the page. Be warned that this erases your entire top artist list.
